Rules of thumb:
---------------
- Standard cost for decorations is 50 per 1 morale
- Decorations that are room-specific can be 1 extra morale
- Core elements for early gameplay are 100-150
- Core elements at mid-game should be 250-300
- Core elements for late-game should be 400-600
- Costs for advanced versions should be multiples

Thoughts...
-----------
- Some realism needs to be used when specifying object costs.  Things
  that in reality seem structurally or materially simple (e.g. tables,
  rugs, plants and shelves) shouldn't be particularly expensive.  They
  may also need to have morale benefits reduced commensurately.
- TVs have a power cost that plants don't, and can only be mounted on
  precious wall space, so should boost morale more than plants.  We swap
  the morale benefits of these two constructions.  We plan to make plants
  produce oxygen, so lessening their morale benefit will avoid them becoming
  too overpowered.
- Pub signs feel like they should be more of a decorative item, but
  having a small morale boost ensures they still have some game purpose.
  And if they have the same game effect, there's really no reason to
  vary their cost.  We can de-nerf them a bit since the addition of the
  jukebox gives larger morale benefits at the larger cost, and pubs in
  general are huge morale boosts already, so reducing the sign benefits
  will tone that down a bit.
- Major de-nerf wall shelves.  They can be built in any room, with no
  power cost, so their morale boost is too overpowered.  Note that
  currently Stuff seems bugged that shelved Stuff doesn't count towards
  morale; once that's fixed then that will make Shelves that much more
  overweighted for morale benefit.  It would be nice if they could be
  restricted only to residences.
- Food replicators tend to need built after the start of the game but
  before pubs, and tend not to be be built after pubs are available.
  Giving them a small morale boost (and making them slightly more
  expensive) will help address the morale crunch early in the game and
  offset the de-nerf of shelves.
- HydroPlants have been changed to allow building them in single tiles,
  making it possible to create them very densely now.  This density
  makes their morale benefits rather huge, so we need to tone that down
  considerably.  Also jack up their cost more to discourage overly
  dense plantings.
