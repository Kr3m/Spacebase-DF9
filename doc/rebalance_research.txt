Thoughts...
-----------
1. Early in the game the research tasks just take plain too long, but
   late in the game when you have plenty of skilled scientists and
   research stations, you quickly run out of things to research.  So as
   a general rule, beginning research needs to be cheaper, and later
   research needs to be more expensive.

2. Player guides on the web seem to suggest the best initial upgrades to
   be body armor, weapons, upgraded recyclers, and upgraded mineral
   processor.  This suggests the research unit amounts for those is ok
   balance-wise so shouldn't be fiddled with.  Everything else is
   probably ok to make a little cheaper to make them a little more
   attractive, or more expensive if their usefulness is more in the
   latter portion of the game.

3. The AirScrubber has a fairly modest impact on the game, and due to
   importance of the oxygen recycler upgrades most players are going to
   be interested in it.  So making this cheaper will not terribly impact
   the game and will help the player feel like they're able to make
   progress up the research tree sooner.

4. Vaporize becomes useful really only when there is an excess of
   derelicts to process, which only happens late in the game.  So we can
   afford to make this one more expensive.

5. Maintenance becomes useful later in the game when the player's
   station is large, so it assists in scaling things up.  We can thus
   make it more expensive since presumably the player will have research
   going strong at this point.

6. We could use a few more simple research items for the early game, in
   the 50-200 research unit range.  Simple things that don't impact game
   play too badly, that will make research more interesting in the early
   part of the game.

7. The number of research items is both too high (the list is
   overwhelming for newbie players to look through), and too low
   (experienced players can exhaust the research items they're
   interested in getting).  With only four research topics available
   from research cubes, after just a few derelicts you will have the
   full set, which is kind of dull and makes derelicts too unrewarding.
   To address these all of needs, move a few of the normal research
   items to require data cubes, and add data cubes for a bunch more
   research topics; strive for a healthy mix of both cheap small
   research items and expensive powerful research items.
