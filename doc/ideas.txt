- global power drain / power production display
- change hydroponics placement, allow to line them up next to each other.  Using all that space doesn't make sense
- interesting research trade-offs (more power, more maintenance required and a greater chance of catastrophic failure)
- Maslow's hierarchy of needs
- mod manager (takes care of the pain of installing mods directly into the game)
- leadership
issue edicts
no eating raw food (workers won't consume from garden's directly)
shifts
set maximum population (prevent immigrants)
- defence airlocks (vent hostiles)
- advanced hostile can override airlock control preventing vent, breach hull causing your workers to vent
- docks/hangar/landing bay
new citizens won't arrive until you have one
dock security
- venting
- defined bases (each has it's own O2/CO2/POWER readings)
- have our own MOTD
- meteor shower - redo completely, hate the current one
- look up interesting space phenomena that can effect a space base
- garden crop, instead of margin have an optional tile display
- create dead zone, noone may enter (prevent people from entering enemy turret LOS)
- capture space worms, tame them as a pet maybe, research them and gain some benefit, containment objects to hold things for study
- skill-up characters in non-job areas, shooting etc.
- oxygen tanks - so you don't have to go back inside to refill
- new game mechanic, heat
- new threat, eclipse - base will freeze
- research upgrade to existing spacesuits to contain heat modules
- enhance characters (genetics/mechanical)
- vermin infestations (space weevil from red dwarf)
- put a freeze on immigration
- blast doors - auto close to save most of rest of base
- Building which gives increased visibility - raiders and immigrants
  must disembark their ships further from your station
- Tractor / repulsion beams
- Heavy Beam Laser.  Slow to power up, and drains a *huge* amount of
  power (sometimes damaging reactors in the process), but is able to
  fire a long, straight beam of energy vaporizing anyone in its path and
  capable of disintegrating enemy ships, derelicts, asteroids, etc.
  Is built as a 6x6 room building
- There needs to be some trade element added, so that stuff you produce
  can be sold to visiting ships.
- Reactors that blow up causing mass destruction
- The event that threatens base deconstruction should actually
  deconstruct part of your base.  Mwahahaha.
- Untended plants can do bad things - explode, cause maladies, turn
  into plant monsters, ...
- More races
- Plasma cannons and gravity guns
- killbot building/buying/reprogramming.  security bots

Rebalance
- use population to determine difficulty
- use Losing is Fun and Building is Fun for difficulty modifier (LF is harder)
- use dock to accept new people, thus preventing the game from getting too difficult too soon
