Spacebase DF-9 v2 - Space station building game

This is a community maintained fork of DoubleFine's original game, which
was open sourced May 12, 2015 under the Common Public Attribution
License (CPAL-1.0: http://opensource.org/licenses/cpal_1.0).  (See
Licensing History below for more discussion).

 
Installation
============
Linux: 

 $ ./packaging/linux_install.sh
	 
This will copy the modified game files on top of your Steam installation
of the game (after backing it up of course!)  This assumes you let Steam
install to its default location (i.e. under ~/.steam/).  If you need to
override the Steam path, this can be done with the STEAM_COMMON env
variable:
	 
  $ STEAM_COMMON="~/Foo/steam/steamapps/common/" ./packaging/linux_install.sh
	 
To restore the original game, just run:

  $ ./packaging/linux_install.sh restore
	 
Or else just direct Steam to re-install Spacebase DF-9.  Note that save
files won't necessarily be backwards compatible!

Windows:

Run the installer found on the spacebasehub.net website.

Bugs
====
If you need to report a bug, please send us an email at
errorlog@spacebasehub.net, including a description of what you were
doing, your log file and a screenshot of the bug - whatever you think
would best help us understand the problem.

You can find your game log at:

  Windows
  <drive>:\Program Files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\SpacebaseDF9\moai_log_space.txt 

  Linux
  ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/SpacebaseDF9/moai_log_Space.txt

If you can, also attach the save game located at:

  Windows
  <drive>:\Users\<your user name>\Documents\SpacebaseDF9\saves\ 

  Linux
  ~/.local/share/doublefine/spacebasedf9/Saves/


Code Style
==========
The code uses 'hungarian notation'.  For an explanation, see

  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2003/09/12/52989.aspx

We believe the meaning is:  n is Number, b is Boolean, t is Table, r is
Reference, e is Enum.

    We’re also pleased to announce we’ll be releasing the game’s full
    Lua source code a short time after 1.0, which will allow the
    community to create potentially far-ranging mods that add content,
    new features, and change some fundamental game behaviors.

    The game’s Lua source code is now available in the game’s install
    directory on all platforms. Usually this will be in your Steam
    directory, under SteamApps\common\SpacebaseDF9\Data\Scripts. If you
    own the game you can modify these files and distribute your
    modifications to other users as you like. A large portion of
    Spacebase is written in Lua, so there are relatively few limits on
    what you can do with this.
